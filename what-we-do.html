                    <h1>Software Development</h1>
                      <p>Perhaps your business has grown and you are struggling to get everything done with the systems which have worked fine up to now? One solution is to employ more staff. A more cost-effective solution would be to build a database application.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps you need better access to information about your business? You know that this information can be obtained from your current systems, but it's a time consuming manual process. A properly designed database application could produce this information for you at the click of a button.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps you have a problem with your current system? The person who developed it has moved on, and you'd like to make changes, but you're not sure how to. Or perhaps you've upgraded your PCs or database software and find you have error messages, or worse still that you've lost your database passwords and can't get in?</p>
                        <p>At Magno we specialize in the design and development of custom software applications and databases systems, in various languages including C#.NET / VB.NET / .NET Framework (Windows), and ASP.NET & PHP (web-based).</p>

                    <h1>Website Design</h1>
                      <p>Whether you are looking for a web directory, an e-commerce store, a website with integrated forum or blog, or something completely different, we can help you plan and realize your idea.</p>
                        <p>Design is of huge importance too. Our designers will work with you to come up with the right look for your site, depending on your target audience. We follow a tried and tested project management methodology, to ensure that the project runs as smoothly as possible, and that any issues which arise are identified and dealt with promptly.</p>
                        <p>We strongly believe in the importance of careful planning, leading to a detailed specification for the site to be built. Above all we passionately believe that communication is the key to success.</p>

                      <p>Once your website has been designed and developed, you can no longer just leave it and expect your number of leads to increase and to get to the top of Google.  Instead, you have to market your website and your online content much like you would market a new product.</p>

The purpose of online marketing is to increase traffic to your website, increase the number of conversions from visitor to lead and increase brand awareness.</p>
                        <p>Online marketing is a very broad topic; however we will identify the solution that works best for you. Whether that's social media marketing, email campaigns, content marketing, SEO or any other suitable method to get your website in the right place on the internet and improve its performance.</p>
